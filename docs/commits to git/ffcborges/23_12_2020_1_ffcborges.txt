----------- D.T.Os. ---------------

Creation of ProjectManagerDTOResponse.java

    This DTO will contain the information of the
    Project Manager(s) requested by the user,
    instead of ProjectManagerDTO used previously.

    It will contain name, email, total number of projects
    and number of projects undergoing execution information


------------- Controllers -----------

    ProjectManagerController was updated to use
    the ProjectManagerDTOResponse.java DTO in GET
    Requests, instead of ProjectManagerDto as it
    did previously


------------- Services -----------

    ProjectManagerService was updated to use
    the ProjectManagerDTOResponse.java DTO in GET
    Requests, instead of ProjectManagerDto as it
    did previously



-----------Models-------------------------

Changes on ProjectManager:
    two new methods were created:

    totalNumberOfProjects():Integer
    numberOfProjectsInExecution():Integer
