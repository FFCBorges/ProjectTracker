----------- D.T.Os. ---------------
Some DTOs were Created
    ClientDTOResponse.java
        To transfer information generated from
        http GET requests regarding a Client or Clients
    EmployeeDTOResponse.java
        To transfer information generated from
        http GET requests regarding a Employee or Employees

Some DTOs were changed
    ProjectValueDTOResponse.java
        A all args constructor was added


------------- Controllers -----------

Some Controllers were changed:

    ClientController.java
        Methods to handle http requests were added:
            GET/client/{id}
            GET/client   (returns all clients)
        minor change was done regarding the relative path of the requests


      EmployeeController.java
         Methods to handle http requests were added:
             GET/employee/{id}
             GET/employee   (returns all employees)
         minor change was done regarding the relative path of the requests

       ProjectController.java
           Methods to handle http requests were added:
             GET/project/{id}
             GET/project   (returns all projects)


------------- Services -----------

Some Service files were changed in order
to keep up with changes at the controller level
namely:

  ClientService.java
  ProjectService.java
  EmployeeService.java

Some methods were trimmed down and the logic of getting
secondary (calculated from several attributes) information
was passed down to the models

   TaskAsPlannedService.java

    some verifications and Exceptions were included in the method
    bindTaskToEmployee() not to allow Employees with the
    "wrong" role to be assigned to Tasks and to inform the end user of such problem.
    (a 404 status was also included for cases where the Task, the Employee or both
    are not found on the DB by the IDs supplied by the end user)




-----------   Models    ---------------
Some Models were Improved upon:

    Client.java
         A Method (getNumberOfOngoingProjects():Integer)was created to return the number
         of ongoing projects (not finished, not dropped)

    Employee.java
        A Method getNumberOfOngoingTasks():Integer was created to return the number
        a given Employee is currently working (or should be...) on

    Project.java
        A Method getManHours():Integer was created to return the flat man hours
        assigned to the project (no distinction regarding employee roles)
